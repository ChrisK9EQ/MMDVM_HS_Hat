# MMDVM_HS_Hat
MMDVM_HS Hat for the Raspberry Pi (Zero)

This project provides a Raspberry Pi Hat for the [MMDVM_HS Hotspot](https://github.com/juribeparada/MMDVM_HS). It was designed for the Raspberry Pi Zero, but should work on any other Pi with the Hat interface. As of now, the board remains untested.

The PCB is designed in KiCad and the necessary libraries are included. The supplied Gerber files can be used to order PCBs, for example at Elecrow or DirtyPCBs.
