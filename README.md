# MMDVM_HS_Hat
MMDVM_HS Hat for the Raspberry Pi (Zero)

This project provides a Raspberry Pi Hat for the [MMDVM_HS Hotspot](https://github.com/juribeparada/MMDVM_HS). It was designed for the Raspberry Pi Zero, but should work on any other Pi with the Hat interface. 

First revisions of the board have been built successfully!

The PCB is designed in KiCad and the necessary libraries are included. The supplied Gerber files can be used to order PCBs, for example at Elecrow or DirtyPCBs. The board's dimensions are 65x30mm.

## BOM
All necessary parts can be ordered at Mouser using the following [shopping cart](http://www.mouser.com/ProjectManager/ProjectDetail.aspx?AccessID=9075204188)

There are a couple of errors in the shopping cart. For now, don't use it, or replace the ADF7021-N with the non-N variant and replace the 0201 parts with their 0402 counterparts. Will fix later.
